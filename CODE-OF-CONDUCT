1. Keep things technical.

This project is technical in nature.

All discussions, debates and interactions must focus on technical aspects
related to the topic at hand.

The code of conduct is not a technical document. Discussions about it, or
suggestions to replace it, violate rule 1.

2. No dumb here.

Don't waste people's time by asking questions you could answer yourself.
Before asking a question, consult the documentation, previous discussion
and most importantly the source code.
